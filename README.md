# Rust Ray Tracing
A simple ray tracer built in Rust, using the 'Ray Tracing in One Weekend' book series by Peter Shirley, which can be found [here](https://raytracing.github.io/).

Implements several standard ray tracer features, allowing a large variety of scenes to be created and rendered. Also implements features such as bounding volume hierarchies in order to optimise the rendering process.

## Examples

#### 'Ray Tracing in One Weekend' Final Scene
